# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict heart disease using the [Heart Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (commonly used from UCI or Kaggle). It demonstrates how to build Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers using **Scikit-learn**, analyze model performance, visualize results, and interpret feature importances.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI / Kaggle Heart Disease dataset
- **Features**: Clinical parameters such as age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.
- **Target**: Presence of heart disease (`1` = disease, `0` = no disease)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (optional)
- Graphviz (for tree visualization)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

- **Decision Tree Classifier**
  - Visualized using `plot_tree`
  - Overfitting controlled by depth, leaf size, etc.
  
- **Random Forest Classifier**
  - Aggregates multiple decision trees for better accuracy
  - Provides feature importance metrics

---

## 📊 Key Features

- ✔️ Data loading and preprocessing
- ✔️ Missing value checks
- ✔️ Model training and evaluation
- ✔️ Accuracy comparison between models
- ✔️ Feature importance plotting
- ✔️ Cross-validation for performance metrics
